This is an ML Project for building an AI based Chest Cancer Detection App and also deploying it onto AWS ECS. A deep learning model with CNN and transfer learning technology has been built and trained with chest CT scan images of several patients and then thoroughly tested and evaluated. Here, goal is to predict if a patient has chest cancer or not and if it is detected, what type of chest cancer it is.   It is a multi-class (4 classes) classification problem.
